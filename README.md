# K-Means Clustering Project README

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of K-Means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering and segmentation tasks, using Python and popular data science libraries. In this project, we use a dataset containing information about colleges and universities to perform K-Means clustering and group the institutions into two clusters based on their characteristics. The main goal is to explore and understand the data patterns and group colleges accordingly.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code in this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- Required Python libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Project Structure

- `KMeans_Clustering_Project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanations for the K-Means clustering analysis.
- `College_Data`: CSV file containing the dataset used for analysis.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`KMeans_Clustering_Project.ipynb`) using your preferred Python IDE or Jupyter Notebook itself.
3. Ensure you have the dataset file named `College_Data` in the same directory as the notebook.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run each cell step by step to follow the K-Means clustering analysis process.
2. The notebook contains detailed comments and explanations for each code cell to help you understand the workflow.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The project starts with exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset's structure and contents:

- Loading the dataset using Pandas.
- Displaying basic statistics and information about the data.
- Visualizing data patterns and relationships between variables using scatter plots and histograms.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is performed to handle anomalies in the dataset:

- Handling a specific data anomaly by setting a graduation rate to 100% for a college.
- Creating a new column (`Cluster`) to convert the categorical variable (`Private`) into numerical values for model evaluation.

## K-Means Clustering

The main part of the project involves applying K-Means clustering:

- Creating a K-Means clustering model using `KMeans` from scikit-learn.
- Fitting the model to the data and identifying cluster centers.
- Visualizing the clustered data and comparing it with the original labels.

## Model Evaluation

To evaluate the clustering results:

- Defining a function to convert the categorical labels into numerical values.
- Comparing the clustering labels with the actual labels using confusion matrix and classification report.
